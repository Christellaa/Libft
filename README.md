# LIBFT

Libft is a custom C library developed as part of the 42 School curriculum.
It consists of recreating some standard C library functions from scratch.
I will be reused in future throughout the 42 curriculum.

## Skills developed
- C programming fundamentals
- Memory management: malloc, free
- Pointer manipulation
- String, array and list handling
- Code modularity and reusability
- Respect of strict coding standards: [42 norm](https://github.com/42school/norminette)

## How to run
```make```

### To include in another C project, compile using:
```#include "libft.h"```
